# ðŸŽ¬ Netflix Movies Analysis (Python)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
In this project, I used **Python (Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib)** to analyze Netflix movies from the **1990s**.  
The dashboard explores movie durations, identifies the most frequent runtime, and examines Action movies with a focus on short films (<90 minutes).

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset contains details about Netflix titles, including:
- **Release Year** (e.g., 1990â€“1999 for this project)  
- **Type** (Movie / TV Show)  
- **Duration** (length in minutes)  
- **Genre** (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama)  
- **Show ID** (unique identifier)

## ðŸ“Š Project Features
- **Filter by Release Year:** Selected only movies released in the 1990s.  
- **Distribution of Movie Durations:** Histogram showing frequency of runtimes.  
- **Most Frequent Duration:** Identified the mode of movie lengths.  
- **Action Movies Analysis:** Subset of Action movies from the 1990s.  
- **Short Action Movies (<90 mins):** Counted how many fall below 90 minutes.

## ðŸ”Ž Insights
- Most 1990s Netflix movies run between **90â€“120 minutes**.  
- The most common runtime was found using **mode analysis**.  
- A group of **short Action movies (<90 mins)** was identified, representing faster-paced films.
