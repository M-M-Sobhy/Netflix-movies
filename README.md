# Netflix-movies
In this project I used Python (NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib) to analyze Netflix movies from the 1990s. It explores KPIs such as the most common movie duration and the distribution of runtimes, while also filtering by genre to identify short Action movies, helping uncover patterns in Netflixâ€™s movie catalog.
